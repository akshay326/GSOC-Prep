ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => viSPLibrary320/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* lint.xml => viSPLibrary320/lint.xml
* res/ => viSPLibrary320/src/main/res/
* src/ => viSPLibrary320/src/main/java/
* src/org/visp/engine/ViSPEngineInterface.aidl => viSPLibrary320/src/main/aidl/org/visp/engine/ViSPEngineInterface.aidl

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
